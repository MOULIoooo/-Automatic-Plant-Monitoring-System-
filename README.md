# -Automatic-Plant-Monitoring-System-
This project is an IoT-based system that continuously monitors plant health using sensors and microcontrollers. It tracks real-time data such as soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity. The data can be displayed on a local screen or sent to the cloud for remote monitoring and analysis, enabling smarter plant care.
