# 🌿 Automatic Plant Monitoring System (IoT-Based)

This project is an IoT-based system that continuously monitors plant health using sensors and microcontrollers. It tracks real-time data such as soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity. The data can be displayed on a local screen or sent to the cloud for remote monitoring and analysis, enabling smarter plant care.

## 📌 Components Used

- Arduino Uno / ESP32
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- DHT11 / DHT22 (Temperature + Humidity Sensor)
- LDR (Light Sensor)
- OLED Display or LCD (optional)
- ESP8266 / ESP32 (for IoT data upload)
- Wi-Fi / Blynk / ThingSpeak (for IoT dashboard)
- Jumper wires, breadboard, and power supply

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Detects dryness and alerts if water is needed.
2. **DHT11 Sensor**: Measures ambient temperature and humidity.
3. **LDR**: Detects light availability for the plant.
4. **Microcontroller**: Reads sensor values and displays/stores data.
5. **IoT Feature (optional)**: Sends data to cloud services like ThingSpeak or Blynk for remote access via mobile.

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Connect all sensors to Arduino/ESP32 as per the circuit.
2. Upload the code using Arduino IDE.
3. Open Serial Monitor or check OLED/IoT Dashboard.
4. Monitor plant health in real time.
